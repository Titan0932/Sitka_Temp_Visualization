# Sitka_Temp_Visualization
An interactive Plotly express visualization of Temperature in Sitka in 2018



It's another very simple program.

It uses a CSV file to extract data and plot them in the graph. Lol I found the resources and help for this pretty complicated and I just messed about it for a while
to get this done. And, surprisingly helped me Understand the library a lot better plus get what I intended to do.

I also added some comments to make things easier to understand.

Its again fairly simple but was really fun to do. 

It also saves an html file of the graph automatically.

P.S create a directory named 'data' and store the csv file there or You may just change the link specified in the 'filename' variable
